# "Making a note discoverable involves making it small, simple, and easy to digest. We accomplish this using compression: creating highly condensed summaries [...]. But we also want to make our notes understandable. This involves including all the context [...]. This is a difficult tradeoff because you cannot compress something without losing some of its context." (Forte 2017:5)
