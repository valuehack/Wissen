"In the end, the collectors fallacy relies on a totalizing vision of knowledge that thinks one can collect everything on a topic, read everything on a topic and turn that complete knowledge into a draft. It does not consider the situatedness of a research project and that new knowledge is created when pieces of knowledge encounter each other, not when gaps in a totalizing knowledge system are filled by adding information. The collector's fallacy should be channeled, not squashed. Cherish your inner "archive fever" — it is your engine — but channel it to productivity. Use strategic procrastination."
