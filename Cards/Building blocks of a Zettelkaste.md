# "Building blocks of a Zettelkasten 1. The Inbox; The gateway to your zettelkasten 2. The Archive; The core of your Zettelkasten 3. The Reference Database; The representation of the world outside your Zettelkasten These are parts of a process, not different tools. Your own finished writing is part of the reference database." (Eriksson 2015:4)
