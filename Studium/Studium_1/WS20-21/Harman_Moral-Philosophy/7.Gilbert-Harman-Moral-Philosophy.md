"People take themselves to have lots of evidence that agents differ in character traits. Yet empirical studies have not found any objective basis for this confidence. Summarising a number of studies, Ross and Nisbett (1991: 95) report that the 'average correlation between different behavioural measures designed to tap the same personality trait (for examples, impulsivity, honesty, dependency, or the like) was typically in the range between 0.10 and 0.20, and often was even lower'. These are very low correlations, below the level which people can detect. Using such correlations to make predictions yields hardly any improvement over guessing.
