["Creating categories is a top-down process. You start with the structure and then file the material away. Notes will have to fit the structure. If they don't, there'll have to be a compromise."

["The brain-Zettelkasten-fit is important. The better your knowledge management system suits the way you think, the easier it'll be to work with the things you put inside. [因 Our brain doesn't work with categories, at least not initially. It may invent categories to become more efficient, but we don't start our lives on pre-existing categories."

["When you learn something new, you collect information and make sense of it afterward. [因This can be called assimilation: new stuff is learned in a way to make use of existing stuff. Existing neural pathways are used. This is the case when you learn the first words of a new language: you translate and remember. Then there's the mode of accommodation, where we start to change the way we think to better understand the object of our interest."

["The only order I opt in to is creation date. [因 humans remember the time of an event well, so you should order material by its date.
