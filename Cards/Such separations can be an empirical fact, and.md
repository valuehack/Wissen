# "Such separations can be an empirical fact, and argument, and its conclusion. A connection can be made by linking between two Zettelns, but it can be made stronger by merging Zettels or by writing a third Zettel that explains the connections between the two Zettels. Connection Zettels can also explain the connection between other connection Zettelns and if this process is expanded you soon end up at the level of the abstract, or outline." (Eriksson 2015:3)
