# "Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and selfhelp books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one's workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery - or insight. Unfortunately, even universities try to turn students into planners." (Ahrens 2017:13)
