# "it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes: 1. Fleeting notes […] 2. Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. […] 3. Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. […] One of the major reasons for not getting much writing or publishing done lies in the confusion of these categories." (Ahrens 2017:43)
