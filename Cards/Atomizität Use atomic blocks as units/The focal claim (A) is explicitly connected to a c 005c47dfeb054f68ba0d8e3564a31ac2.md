# "The focal claim (A) is explicitly connected to a claim from another study that closely replicates it (B), and implicitly connected to a similar (but not exactly alike) claim (C). Another claim about the amount of reading scientists must do (D) suggests a potential explanation for scientists' reading behaviors. Clicking on a "min/max" button on the context segments toggles whether they are expanded or collapsed (E). If the user needs more information, there is a direct link (F) back to the location surrounding the claim." (Qian et al 2019:343)
