# "A cloze deletion is an item that uses an ellipsis ([...]) to replace a part of a sentence. […] Remember cloze will convert a sentence into a specific question with an answer. By using cloze, you will move from passive review to active recall. […] For your most important material, you can create cloze items immediately after finding a piece of information that you need to remember well." (Wozniak :8)
