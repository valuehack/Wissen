# "the cognitive costs of deciding in advance what details need to be retained as context for future reuse [2], with costly consequences for downstream task performance if a premature and inaccurate decision is made early on [15]. Also, systems that require high amounts of precision for specifying context during sensemaking may impose unnecessary interaction costs" (Qian et al 2019:343)
