# "This approach is really similar to Cal Newport's technique to start a paper with a few topic notes, paste in all the quotes, and finally write a coherent text around these: Step 3: Dump the Quotes In the document containing your topic skeleton: start typing, under each topic, all of the quotes from your sources that you think are relevant. Label each quote with the source it came from. We call the final document a topic-level outline. Unlike the compact, hierarchical outlines promoted by the orthodoxy, a topic-level outline is huge (close the size of your finished paper), and flat in structure (no reason to use 18 different levels of indentations here.) Step 4: Transform, Don't Create When you write your paper, don't start from a blank document. Instead, make a copy of your topic-level outline and transform it into the finished paper. For each topic, begin writing, right under the topic header, grabbing the quotes you need as you move along. Remember, these quotes are right below you in the document and are immediately accessible." (Tietze 2014:3)
