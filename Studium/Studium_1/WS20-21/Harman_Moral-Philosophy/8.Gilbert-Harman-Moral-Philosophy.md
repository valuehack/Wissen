"our attributions tend to be wildly incorrect and, in fact, there is no evidence that people differ in character traits. They differ in their situations and in their perceptions of their situations. They differ in their goals, strategies, neuoses, optimism, etc." ([Harman 1999:330](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CC8CW56M?page=16))
