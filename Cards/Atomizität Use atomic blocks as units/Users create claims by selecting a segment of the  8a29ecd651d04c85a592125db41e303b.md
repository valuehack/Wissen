# "Users create claims by selecting a segment of the source document in the reading pane and writing a (re)description of the associated claim. […] Users can adjust "flexibly compressed" context segments. For example, a user can scroll up in the segment to note that evidence for this claim comes from interviews […] and reason about reliability/diversity of evidence, or extract more details about which sections tend to be read for what kinds of tasks to inform design of a system that highlights specific sections for specific tasks."
