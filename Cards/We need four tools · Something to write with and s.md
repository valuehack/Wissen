# "We need four tools: · Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do) · A reference management system (the best programs are free) · The slip-box (the best program is free) · An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free) […] I strongly recommend using Daniel Lüdecke's Zettelkasten. It is the only program I know that really implements the principles behind Luhmann's system and is at the same time simple and easy to use." (Ahrens 2017:33)
