# "A remaining controversy regards the historicity of Folgezetteln. Do they have a place in a digital Zettelkasten, or were they simply a by-product of the material constraints of index cards? A simple addition to a note that remains "sticky" is meaningless in a digital Zettelkasten, but serves a purpose in an index card based system. For a note to achieve the status of a Zettel it must be independent and be able to be a part of several sequences or relate to several notes. Likewise, a Zettel can become too sticky if other Zettelns would like to refer to a part of the Zettel. In this case, one can consider splitting the Zettel into two independent arguments with a link between them. This necessity of linking to a part of a Zettel could be used as the indicator that a Zettel has become too sticky instead of making Zettelns that are too loose by prematurely creating new ones. Another indicator that it is time to split a Zettel is that it keeps showing up in search results although you were only looking for a specific part of it." (Eriksson 2015:6)
