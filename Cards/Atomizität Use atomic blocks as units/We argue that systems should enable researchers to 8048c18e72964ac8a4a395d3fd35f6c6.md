# "We argue that systems should enable researchers to work directly with grounded claims. Grounded claims are concise statements grounded in context that helps a user understand, interpret, judge, and use a claim (see Fig. 1). For example, a claim might be contextualized by its evidence, such as a key figure or experiment details, or related claims that corroborate, oppose, or clarify a focal claim. The provenance of a claim, such as its source collaboration networks, institutional dynamics, and prestige, can be important context for understanding its validity and impact" (Qian et al 2019:342)
