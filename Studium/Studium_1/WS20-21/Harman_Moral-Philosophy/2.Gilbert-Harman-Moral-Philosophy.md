"In attempting to characterise and explain the movements of a body, folk physics places too much emphasis on assumed internal characteristics of the body, ignoring external forces. Similarly, in trying to characterise and explain a distinctive action, ordinary thinking tends to hypothesise a corresponding distinctive characteristic of the agent and tends to overlook the relevant details of the agent's perceived situation.' Because of this tendency, folk social psychology and more specifically folk morality are subject to what Ross (1977) calls 'the fundamental attribution error'" ([Harman 1999:317](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CC8CW56M?page=3))
