"It is very hard to do studies that might indicate whether or not people differ in character traits, but the few studies that have been done do not support this idea. [...] ordinary thinking about character traits has deplorable results, leading to massive misunderstanding of other people, promoting unnecessary hostility between individuals and groups, distorting discussions of law and public policy, and preventing the implementation of situational changes that could have useful results." ([Harman 1999:331](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CC8CW56M?page=17))
