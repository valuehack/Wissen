"Darley and Batson (1973) [...] designed an experiment [...] Subjects in this experiment were students at Princeton Theological Seminary. As each subject arrived, he was informed that he was to give a talk that would be recorded in another building. Along the way to the place for the talk, the subject encountered a 'victim' slumped in a doorway. The question was under what conditions would a subject stop to help the victim."
