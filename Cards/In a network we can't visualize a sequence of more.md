# "In a network we can't visualize a sequence of more than one jump. If the relations are to come in the form of a database, that is as a network, then the sequencing need to happen with manually constructed outlines indexing sequences of jumps throughout the network. This is similar to how a wiki relies of indexes of links between files or parts of files. In a file-system based organisation on the other hand, a note can't be part of several histories unless there is a merge of these histories into one future." (Eriksson 2015:7)
