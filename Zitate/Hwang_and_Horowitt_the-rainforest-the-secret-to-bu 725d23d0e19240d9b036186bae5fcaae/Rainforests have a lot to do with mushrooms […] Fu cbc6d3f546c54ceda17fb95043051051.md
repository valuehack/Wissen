# "Rainforests have a lot to do with mushrooms. [因 Fungi are among the most robust biological systems on Earth. [因 A mycelium does not have a "body" per se. It is made entirely of hyphae, which are long, thin tubes filled with liquid that act like a complex web of veins. [因 Anastomosis happens when the ends of the hyphae networks become fused together [因 When a fungus attains anastomosis, you can cut off part of the system, but the rest of it stays alive. The circulation of vital fluids is always able to reach any part of the network, no matter which part is damaged. In addition, the mycelium has the ability to absorb nutrients from anywhere in the network and distribute them to the rest of the system." (Hwang and Horowitt 2012:226)
