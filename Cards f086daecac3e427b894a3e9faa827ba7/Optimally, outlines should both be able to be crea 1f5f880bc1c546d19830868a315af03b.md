# "Optimally, outlines should both be able to be created manually by the author - and then be considered in some form or another as an abstract - or rendered dynamically by a search function and should then be considered to be indexes of links between Zettelns. A way to test the strength of an outline or an abstract is to fill it with notes. Is every argument supported by well-written Zettelns? IS new research needed? Can you build a strong foundation for an argument by making connections between more notes?" ([[Eriksson 2015]]:9)
