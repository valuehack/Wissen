# "We've recently seen an explosion in Tools for Networked Thought like Roam Research, Obsidian, Semilattice, and so on and so forth. These tools create value because they allow users to create knowledge associatively, divergently, and then emergently. This is more important now than ever before because in the past few decades we've seen exponential growth in data and information. However, our ability to make sense of these inputs, to convert data and information to knowledge and wisdom, is already capped by the mainstream tools today. Using a graph database, bi-directional links, and hypertext transclusions, these tools enable users to create and traverse knowledge in a way that mirrors how humans organically create knowledge â€” associatively and contextually. These "knowledge graphs" break out of the "file-and-cabinet" hierarchical paradigm" (Tang 2020:1)
