# "the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant. The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Ideally, it rhymes as well […] Everything that is rather abstract, vague, emotionally neutral or does not even sound good is far down on its list of priorities - not exactly the best criteria for an intellectual endeavour. It makes things worse that we tend to like our first ideas the best and are very reluctant to let go of them, irrespective of their actual relevance […] More people in a brainstorming group usually come up with less good ideas and restrict themselves inadvertently to a narrower range of topics" (Ahrens 2017:123)
