["Collecting does not transform us and always postpones learning and transformation to the future. Collecting creates debt that we promise to pay back in some future that never arrives. The collection allow us to imagine ourselves in the near future as a person who has read and understood the collected material."

["Reading can also be subject to the collectors fallacy. Then we read unsystematically - without taking notes or integrating what we understood into our knowledge system - then reading is merely a short-term feeling of understanding."

["In the end, the collectors fallacy relies on a totalizing vision of knowledge that thinks one can collect everything on a topic, read everything on a topic and turn that complete knowledge into a draft. It does not consider the situatedness of a research project and that new knowledge is created when pieces of knowledge encounter each other, not when gaps in a totalizing knowledge system are filled by adding information. The collector's fallacy should be channeled, not squashed. Cherish your inner "archive fever" — it is your engine — but channel it to productivity. Use strategic procrastination."
