# "In Knowledge Compressor, claims can be grounded by two kinds of context: 1) evidence: claims can be easily linked to one or more "segments" of a source PDF document (e.g., table, figure, methods details, quote) (see Fig. 3) and 2) related claims: claims can be connected (either with explicit links, or implicitly, by spatial proximity) to other claims on our claim canvas, which operates similarly to argument diagramming and modeling software" (Qian et al 2019:343)
